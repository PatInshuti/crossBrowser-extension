Participants were undergraduate students at
LUMS. We advertised our study through university emails
and student-focused Facebook groups. Participants were com-
pensated with food coupons worth roughly $2.15.

Participants were asked to install our extension which collected
the required data.

The first thing that the extension does after installation
is disclose all information collection to the user and ask for
consent. No data is collected until the user consents. All the
responses are anonymized.

Also, Before we began data collection, we obtained IRB
approval for our methodology from LUMS.
